javaonrails
===========

java application, which is developed with this lib, could be deplyed as modules, and could be loaded, run, updated and removed dynamically at runtime, but it is more lightly and easier than osgi. you can develop a java project with it, just like to develope a common java project with struts spring and hibernate.
